To do so, roll one D6: this unit can be moved a number of inches up to the result, but this unit must finish that move as close as possible to the closest enemy unit (excluding Aircraft). When doing so, those models can be moved within Engagement Range of that enemy unit. A unit cannot make a Blood Surge move while it is Battle-shocked."
